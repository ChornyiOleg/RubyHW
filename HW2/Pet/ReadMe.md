SoftsKILLER is a suicidal toy who likes to watch horrors, which causes him to lose his self-control and may drive himself to suicide.
You have 4 ways to influence his fate, save his life (even though he is suicidal) or help him in his suicide plans by choosing the best way to die:

     1 - Watch a horror movie  
     2 - Calm down, buddy
     3 - Need a psychologist
     4 - Tell him a way to die

Press 1, 2, 3, 4 on the keyboard and decide his fate. Whether you become his savior or his executioner is up to you!
