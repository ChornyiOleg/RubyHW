Separate Reference and Sample Data\r\nRails provides a rails db:seed command that makes it easy to set up initial data in a database. But what kind of data is that supposed to be? There are at least two kinds of initial data:\r\n\r\nReference data: data needed in all environments, from dev to production. This could include things like lists of countries and states. Usually hard-coded data.\r\nSample data: data needed only for the dev environment, so that there are already fake records in every table to make the app easy to interact with. Usually generated with Factory Girl.\r\nThe seeds file is commonly used for both of these, but that makes it difficult to set up initial data in production. The Rails guides don’t make it clear which of these the seeds file is for.\r\n\r\nIt can be useful to separate the two out. Thoughtbot recommends using the seeds file for reference data, and setting up a separate Rake task for sample data. A plain bin script could also work in place of a Rake task.", "image"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Create Post"}
